# Description

This repository contains a .NET Core Web application, unit tests and Dockerfile.

This Dockerfile is horrible, you may want to fork this repository, fix all the problems and try to update the workflow.

I recommend you to use https://github.com/marketplace/actions/container-structure-test-action to ensure the docker image quality.
